Apigility Skeleton Application with Symfony3 integration
========================================================

The goal of this project is to use Apigility to take advantage of the powerful
API's creation and management tools offered by Apigility and, at the same time,
to use Symfony3 framework to add the required operation functionality.

# How to integrate both frameworks

Clone this project:

    git clone https://github.com/yuido/apigility-with-sf3

Install vendors:

    cd apigility-with-sf3
    composer.phar install

Deploy a Sf3 project:

    cd ..
    symfony new sf

Et voil√°, you are ready to use the power of both frameworks.
